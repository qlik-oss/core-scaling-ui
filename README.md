# Core Scaling UI

This repository contains the source code for the Core Scaling UI.
Currently under heavy development.

## Developing the UI

* Start the Qlik Associative Engine in a Docker container.
  Note that before you deploy, you need to set the `ACCEPT_EULA` environment variable,
  otherwise the Qlik Associative Engine won't start.

  ```bash
  ACCEPT_EULA=yes docker-compose up -d
  ```

* Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
* Run the application:
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
* Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the UI.
